Expo Snack / Expo project for the Kalori Simulator

Files:
- App.js : React Native app (Expo) implementing the simulator UI and Calc button
- package.json : minimal package declaring Expo dependency

Run locally (if you have Node.js + Expo CLI installed):

1) Install Expo CLI if you don't have it:

   npm install -g expo-cli

2) From the `expo_snack` folder install dependencies:

   npm install

3) Start the project:

   npm start

This will open the Expo DevTools; you can run on a connected device or emulator, or open the project in Snack by copying `App.js` into https://snack.expo.dev/.

Notes:
- The `package.json` uses Expo SDK 48 as an example; adjust versions if you need a different SDK.
- For quick testing, just paste `App.js` into an online Snack at https://snack.expo.dev/ and run in the browser or device.
